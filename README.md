## Overview
A face-detecting security measure that opens the webcam and takes a snapshot of a lurking individual's face during vulnerable moments such as logging into banking accounts, filling out tax forms, and registering for credit cards. Designed to protect sensitive information like SSN, bank account login information, etc. from unauthorized access. 

The primary function is to detect faces other than the user's face, if the person is looking directly at the screen from some distance. 

Made using OpenCV library.

## Possible Uses:
Customer-focused safety solution; deployable for mobile apps using pre-existing biometrics measures (iPhone facial recognition), PNC mobile banking app, FAFSA, etc.  


## Installation
Pre-reqs: Have Python installed on VSCode. 

Clone the repository.

In terminal: pip3 install opencv-python
Create virtual environment: python3 -m venv OPENCV
Activate: source OPENCV/bin/activate
Install pip: pip3 install --upgrade pip
Install opencv in venv: pip3 install opencv-python
Select python interpreter (CMD+SHIFT+P)- it should match your new venv name

Now you are ready to catch the password thieves!
